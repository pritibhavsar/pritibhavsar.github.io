Sites are containers which store libraries and lists. Users often navigate directly to a site and are redirected to its homepage.</li>\n<li>Libraries: Located within sites, libraries store items that are ‘files’. Examples include Site Pages, Images, Videos, Documents. These are all stored in libraries.</li>\n<li>Lists: Similar to libraries, except instead of storing files they store ‘items’. An item, in many ways, is akin to a line of structured information from a table or database.</li>\n<li>Folders: Located in libraries and lists, folders are sub containers with names.</li>\n<li>Metadata: The properties that are applied to items inside libraries or lists.</li>\n<li>Managed metadata: A centralized version of metadata that can be managed in an enterprise way.</li>\n<li>Content Types: A definition created for a type of item being added to the system. It can be used to define how the item is treated i.e. what metadata is needed for a type of document, or what retention schedule should be applied. You can learn all about content types here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"creating-an-information-architecture\" style=\"position:relative;\">Creating an Information Architecture<a href=\"#creating-an-information-architecture\" aria-label=\"creating an information architecture permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Now that we understand the nature of our content, and the building blocks available to us, we can start to create elements of the Information Architecture. Let us take an example of an Intranet with an HR section. This needs to store HR forms, policies, key contacts, and news. The following is an example of a simple model that could be created within SharePoint:</p>\n<p>We have used a combination of Site, Pages, and Lists to best represent the content. One of the challenges of building a good IA, is that there are a number of different ways of representing any given set of content.
