BI tools access and analyze data sets and present analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts and maps to provide users with detailed intelligence about the state of the business.<br>The term business intelligence often also refers to a range of tools that provide quick, easy-to-digest access to insights about an organization's current state, based on available data.</div>\n    <div class=\"item50 Normal\">\n      When businesses make investments in new technologies, they usually do so with the intention of creating value for customers and stakeholders and making smart long-term investments. This is not always an easy thing to do when implementing cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Business intelligence case studies that show how these technologies have been leveraged with results are still scarce, and many companies wonder where to apply machine learning first (a question at the core of one of Emerj’s most recent expert consensuses.)\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item50\">\n      <img src=\"/0f3ae148b0e90f9b23c10014297c32cc/bi_1.svg\" alt=\"Business Intelligence\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item50\">\n      <img src=\"/4765924bae3ab383809487ecc8113ce2/bi_2.svg\" alt=\"Business Intelligence\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item50 Normal\">\n      Artificial intelligence and machine learning have certainly increased in capability over the past few years. Predictive analytics can help glean meaningful business insights using both sensor-based and structured data, as well as unstructured data, like unlabeled text and video, for mining customer sentiment. In the last few years, a shift toward “cognitive cloud” analytics has also increased data access, allowing for advances in real-time learning and reduced company costs. This recent shift has made an array of advanced analytics and AI-powered business intelligence services more accessible to mid-sized and small companies.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"Center Normal\">\n      In the age of information, business information and intelligence, if utilized strategically, has the power to propel a business far above their competitors as well as exponentially boost brand awareness, internal engagement, organizational efficiency, and profitability.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"Center Bold\">\n      <h3> We are offering following types of Business Intelligence Skills:</h3>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item50 Normal\">\n    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>We are offering Business Analysis portfolios tools having ability to translate data into actionable information, so that organizations can make decisions that will enhance profitability and productivity. <br>\n    <br>\n    Following tools help us to make a strong player in this area:\n    <ul><li> Database management </li>\n    <li> Survey design </li>\n    <li> Formulating data queries </li>\n    <li> SAS </li>\n    <li> SPS </li>\n    <li> Coding data </li>\n    <li> Drawing inferences </li>\n    <li> Applying scientific methods to gathering data </li>\n    <li> Critical thinking </li>\n    <li> Quantitative analysis </li>\n    <li> SQL programming </li>\n    <li> Identifying high-value areas for inquiry </li>\n    <li> Establishing benchmarks </li>\n    <li> Identifying and measuring correlations </li>\n    <li> Intellectual curiosity </li>\n    <li> Classifying data </li>\n    <li> Strategic planning </li></ul>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item50\">\n      <img src=\"/a736154945a45403a1a57a9f135cda41/bi_4.svg\" alt=\"Data Analysis\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item50\">\n      <img src=\"/ccaf95ce1d81ea19967d339e1f9d7616/bi_5.svg\" alt=\"Industry Knowledge\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item50 Normal\">\n  <h3>Industry Knowledge</h3>We leverage on following focus area to build a strong relationship with different domains and industries expertise: <ul>\n  <li> Industry trend analysis </li>\n  <li> Interpreting professional literature </li>\n  <li> Identifying best practices </li>\n  <li> Building relationships with industry experts and influencers </li>\n  <li> Participating in industry-focused professional meetings and conferences </li></ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"item50 Normal\">\n  <h3>Problem Solving</h3>Having strong knowledge and experience in different domains and industries, it helps us to make easy to take a decision.
